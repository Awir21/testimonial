                    I have been solving all the project ideas on <span class="highlight">roadmap.sh</span> and I am
                    surprised how far I have come from where I started.

                    Since starting my career in 2021, I have only followed one resource, <span
                        class="highlight">roadmap.sh</span>. It truly helped me go from 0 to having a job and changing
                    the financial trajectory of my family.

                    I find myself recommending <span class="highlight">roadmap.sh</span> to all the interns or junior
                    developers. It's a great way to skill up and grow in your career.

                    <span class="highlight">roadmap.sh</span> is an incredible resource. I was fortunate to discover it
                    during my university days in 2018. Back then, it was just a single repository with three images.
                    <br><br>
                    It's amazing to see how much impact it has had on millions of lives since then.
